# MQTT

This was a graduate course (EE281) project we implemented using Raspberry Pi3 (OS-NOOBS) as the broker and Spark Photon as the client.
We used "Mosquitto" open-source broker in the RP3 to make it as a private broker.
Python script were added to the RP3 to initialize MQTT protocol. Similarly, arduino scripts used for spark photon.
For GUI, we used HomeAssistant (https://home-assistant.io/) which is an open-source python based GUI tool.
